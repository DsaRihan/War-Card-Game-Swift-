## How to Play

- **Objective**: The goal is to win all the cards.
- **Gameplay**:
  1. The player and the system each start with a deck of cards.
  2. The player clicks the "Deal" button to draw a card from both the player and the system's decks.
  3. The higher card value wins the round, and the score is updated accordingly:
     - Player's score increases if the player's card is higher.
     - System's score increases if the system's card is higher.
  4. In the case of a tie, a "war" is triggered:
     - Both the player and the system draw three cards face down and a fourth card face up.
     - The higher fourth card wins all the cards on the table, and the score is updated.
  5. The game continues until one player has all the cards or a predefined number of rounds is completed.
